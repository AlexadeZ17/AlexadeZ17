I am √Ålex Rodr√≠guez P√©rez, an 18 year old Computer Science student who has always been playing around with computers and programming. In my github you will find everything that I do during my degree, Hackathons, Personal projects and much more! If you like what I do feel free to give some stars, follow me or contact me if you need something!

## Education: 42 Barcelona

I am currently studying at 42 Barcelona, part of the 42 Network, considered to be the most innovative coding school worldwide. Here you can see how am I doing thereüëá

## Education: UNED

Aside from studying Software Development at 42 Barcelona, I am also studying Computer Science at UNED, the Online University of Spain. Here you can see some of the code I write on exercices or to understand better how things work. Not too interesting tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Projects and Competitions

As a competitive student and someone who loves challenges, I am always signing up for Hackathons and Coding challenges, so in this section you will see all the work I did in those competitions and also how they ranked (If available)

### Competitions

<details>
  <summary>
    High School Big Data Challenge (STEM Fellowship)
  </summary>
  
üëâThis competition focused on giving solutions aiming to solve SDG 7 (Afordable and Clean Energy). Along with my teammate, Andrei Dumitrache, we created a Genetic Algorithm from scratch that could find the optimal combination of 3 renewable energy resources üå± that could give the most energy without overpassing a given budget üí∞.
  
  We submitted our code along with a paper explaining our solution, how and why we decided to do everything we decided to do. We were awarded with the **2nd Place Hunter Hub University of Calgary Entrepeneurship Award** and **3rd Place Let's Talk Science Analythics Award**
  
  You can find the repo with all the code and our submitted paper [here](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/STEMFellowship_Alex_Andrei) and the official competition's [webpage](https://stemfellowship.org/2021-22-hsbdc/)

### Hackathons

 <details>
  <summary>
    Datathon FME 2022
  </summary>
  
  üëâ This hackathon, organized by the faculty of math and statistics of UPC (FME) and the Asociation of Data science (AED) aimed to give Data Science solutions to real challenges given by real businesses such as Accenture or Qualcomm.
  
  Our team üë®‚Äçüíª , composed by freshman students from the Data Science Major and Computer Science Major worked hard to give a feasable solution to the challenges üî® propposed by the sponsors.
  
  You can find our work on this [repository](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/datathon2022-alex-gerard-laia-joan) :octocat:
