# Welcome to my Github Page! ‚úåÔ∏è

## whoami

I am √Ålex Rodr√≠guez P√©rez, an 18 year old Computer Science student who has always been playing around with computers and programming. In my github you will find everything that I do during my degree, Hackathons, Personal projects and much more! If you like what I do feel free to give some stars, follow me or contact me if you need something!

## Education: 42 Barcelona

I am currently studying at 42 Barcelona, part of the 42 Network, considered to be the most innovative coding school worldwide. Here you can see how am I doing thereüëá

## Education: UNED

Aside from studying Software Development at 42 Barcelona, I am also studying Computer Science at UNED, the Online University of Spain. Here you can see some of the code I write on exercices or to understand better how things work. Not too interesting tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<details>
  <summary>
    ft_append
  </summary>

üëâ While I was in a Data Science Programming class, the teacher explained lists in python, and how we could append data at the end of them. I considered interesting to re-create this function on C in order to understand how it worked this function under the hood ‚öôÔ∏è. The following [gist](https://gist.github.com/AlexadeZ17/002652b040f3ba119a94182afca60caf) shows the code I wrote.

## Projects and Competitions

As a competitive student and someone who loves challenges, I am always signing up for Hackathons and Coding challenges, so in this section you will see all the work I did in those competitions and also how they ranked (If available)

### Competitions

<details>
  <summary>
    High School Big Data Challenge (STEM Fellowship)
  </summary>
  
üëâ This competition focused on giving solutions aiming to solve SDG 7 (Afordable and Clean Energy). Along with my teammate, Andrei Dumitrache, we created a Genetic Algorithm from scratch that could find the optimal combination of 3 renewable energy resources üå± that could give the most energy without overpassing a given budget üí∞.
  
  We submitted our code along with a paper explaining our solution, how and why we decided to do everything we decided to do. We were awarded with the **2nd Place Hunter Hub University of Calgary Entrepeneurship Award** and **3rd Place Let's Talk Science Analythics Award**
  
  You can find the repo with all the code and our submitted paper [here](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/STEMFellowship_Alex_Andrei) and the official competition's [webpage](https://stemfellowship.org/2021-22-hsbdc/)

### Hackathons

 <details>
  <summary>
    Datathon FME 2022
  </summary>
  
  üëâ This hackathon, organized by the faculty of math and statistics of UPC (FME) and the Asociation of Data science (AED) aimed to give Data Science solutions to real challenges given by real businesses such as Accenture or Qualcomm.
  
  Our team üë®‚Äçüíª , composed by freshman students from the Data Science Major and Computer Science Major worked hard to give a feasable solution to the challenges üî® propposed by the sponsors.
  
  You can find our work on this [repository](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/datathon2022-alex-gerard-laia-joan) :octocat:

### Personal Projects: CyberSecurity üëÆ

Cybersecurity is the field of computer science I like the most. It requires deep understanding on almost every topic of computer science in order to know how things can be used in a way they are not intended to. It also requires to think creatively üé® to find those unexpected behaviours, or to fix them üîß. This, and many other things are what makes me love so much cybersecurity and thus, it deserves a space here. Those are some of the programming projects I developed (will be updated since most of them have to be recovered from a broken computer) üíª

<details>
  <summary>
    SecureFolders
  </summary>
  
  When I first started to investigate about cybersecurity and learning things, I felt eagger to develope something that could help making computers a bit more secure. At that time I still had few knowledge about the field, but anyways, I created this program called _Secure Folders_ which aimed to make folders only accesible with a password. This is not quite the case since anyone could bring the folder back to normal again without authenticating, but still, I feel proud of what I was able to do üí™. This [repo](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/SecureFolders) contains all the code I wrote, both graphical and non graphical versions.

## Self learning notes

As a curious person I'm always learning new things. On this section of my github you will find the notes I take on every thing I study on my own such as prepparation for certifications, experience-based learning or online courses I take just for fun. Each note section is a github :octocat: repository with all relevant information and the actual notes. Here you will find just an index of them and the links to those repos.

<details>
  <summary>
    eJPT preparation
   </summary>
  
   üëâ On this [notes](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/eJPT) you will find all my notes of what I study towards pepearing myself for the eJPT certification üë®‚Äçüéì. It will be my very first relevant CyberSecurity certification. I mean to make it for my own understanding and not as a "course" for others, although it might be helpful for some people to prepeare aswell.

  <summary>
    HTB write ups
   </summary>
   
   In this section I'll be posting write ups and notes of the Hack The Box machines I solve to train myself on cybersecurity. Notice that all the machines that I will be posting write ups on are retired machines and thus, I am allowed to publish them. You will also find here all the code I wrote to solve the machine or to automate the process.
   
   The [repo](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/HTB-writeups) :octocat: has all the folders with each machine on a separate folder.

    Ransomware Forensics Workshop
   </summary>
   
   This was a workshop organized by 42 Barcelona and Central IP, a cybersecurity consulting company üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. In this talk we were able to analyze several real-case ransomware atacks and the way they gained acces to the computers and executed that ransomware üîê. We also took a look at the criminal organzations that was behind them and how they were structured based on the Bitcoin payment trail üí∞.
   
   It was a really interesting workshop to know how ransomware worked and how it was introduced into companyes, as well as looking into the criminal structure.
